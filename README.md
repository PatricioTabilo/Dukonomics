**Your gold history, simplified.**

**Stop guessing where your gold went.**
Dukonomics tracks everything automatically. It records every sale, purchase, and cancellation to show you exactly what matters: your real profit. It also monitors your **active auctions across all characters**, so you always know who has items listed and who needs to restock.

To ensure accuracy, it validates data via your mailbox to capture what the standard API misses. No configuration needed—just the insights you need to make more gold.

## See your history clearly

Dukonomics organizes your transaction history into a **unified accounting overview** that supports:

- **True Profit**: Automatically tracks expenses against earnings to show what you really made.
- **Active Auctions**: Monitor active postings across your whole account. Know at a glance which characters have items listed and which ones are empty.
- **Account-Wide View**: See data across all your characters or filter for specific alts.
- **Smart Filters**: Search by item or check specific timeframes (24h, 7 Days, Month, All Time). You can also enable **Remember filter settings** to keep your preferences across all characters and sessions.

## Native by Design

An accounting tool shouldn't feel like a spreadsheet overlay. Dukonomics is built to look and feel like a standard part of the World of Warcraft interface—lightweight, unobtrusive, and instantly familiar.

## Getting Started

No configuration needed. Just install and play.

- **Access**: Click the minimap button or type `/dukonomics` to toggle the main window.
